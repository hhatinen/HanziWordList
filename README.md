HanziWordList
=============

Generates word lists categorized by their individual component characters. Can be useful Mandarin learning tool for beginners!

Disclaimer
----------

I don't take any responsibility on the code. The code is horrible and was written very quickly as experiment. Feel free to do anything you want with it.

Info
----

The project contains two files:
 - hanziwordlist_nolibdependencies.py
   - Version of the script that doesn't use any external libraries. Use this if you're too lazy for installing cjklib. Your words wont get sorted by stroke count though!
 - hanziwordlist.py
   - The "full" version of the script. Uses cjklib for sorting words and characters by stroke count. More info with installation instructions [here](https://code.google.com/p/cjklib/)
